Hey guys,

Looks like this assignment is pretty straightforward. We have a choice of what dataset we want to use, we can source from kaggle, AWS open data, UCI machine learning repository etc.
I dont care what set we work with. Ill list some suggestions later on today. 

Emphasis on assignment:
    1.) Preprocessing techniques applied to dataset.
    2.)Input-output documented.
    3.)Explanation on how preprocessing would help future mining.
