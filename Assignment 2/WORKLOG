Hey guys,

Looks like this assignment is pretty straightforward. We have a choice of what dataset we want to use, we can source from kaggle, AWS open data, UCI machine learning repository etc.
I dont care what set we work with. Ill list some suggestions later on today. 

Emphasis on assignment:
    1.) Preprocessing techniques applied to dataset.
    2.)Input-output documented.
    3.)Explanation on how preprocessing would help future mining.

Guys free to edit these worklogs to discuss whatever it is you want, and whatever changes you make to the code. Since there is no issue on what dataset we use 
Ill upload housing market data in california. We will preprocess the data for multiple regression prediction.  

3 Techniques for preprocessing:

1.) One hot encoding string variables. Preprocessing type: Numerization for string variables.  
2.) Feature selection using l2 normalization (ridge regression). Preprocessing type :DATA REDUCTION & FEATURE SELECTION
3.) Normalization for l2 normalization. Preprocessing type: Z-score normalization
