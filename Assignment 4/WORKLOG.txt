Assignment 4 entails predictive datamining. We can do Lasso/Ridge regression for prediction, or another 
form of multivariate regression. 

Lasso Regression  also functions as feature selection 

Lambda selection via cross validation (parameter to be manipulated for assignment) RMSE 

Predicition can be for failure rate of x such as risk of default (Depends on the dataset)
=========================================================================================

Credit card default. (0) 

Use Lasso regression to determine risk of default based on specific feature vectors, lasso will show us what inputs 
a user would need to give in order to infer an accurate predicition. This is very beneficial and unlike multivariate regression,
allows us to pinpoint productive and meaningful user inputs.

Lasso will give us inference and operate as feature selection since it can shrink coefficients down to 0.

Lambda will be manipulated and MSE/RMSE etc will be used as loss f(x)'s to determine difference in predictive accuracy.
