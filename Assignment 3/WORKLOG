Decided on k-means clustering for wine dataset. 

General Steps:

Import data (steve) 
clean ()
Feature scaling (min-max since were working in euclidean distance based algo) (steve)

Set train set, test set and validation set (ensure that our algorithm is better than random assignment) [50-25-25] (thomas)

Determine optimal number of K based off of SSE error using the elbow method: (murak)

Execute kmeans with optimal k, and go over findings. 

Summarize 

****We CAN also do PCA upstream from clustering to help with computations**** 

....develope pipeline for this ?
